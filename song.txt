[Verse 1]
How could you do this?
We'll never be the same
You're gonna regret this
You're gonna remember my name
Cause in the end, girl
You just got yourself to blame
It was amazing
But now everything has changed
We had it all, babe
You've thrown it all away
I'll say it again, girl
You've just got yourself to blame

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't try to lie 'cause I know where you've been
You made a choice when you made out with him
Now all I can see in my dreams is him touching your skin

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's too bad
You know that it's so sad
You should have known that
It would be over

Baby, it's too late
We had it so great
The moment a heart breaks
You know it's over
